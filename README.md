# Graph Theory Applet
View the generation and solving of a perfect maze.

### Algorithms
__Randomized Prim's Algorithm__ Used to generate a Minimum Spanning Tree which will visually become a "perfect" maze (one with only one solution).

__Dijkstra's Algorithm__ Used to solve the maze generated by Prim's algorithm.

### Tech
This was developed using IntelliJ to launch an applet from within the IDE.
